## Working with Index

```sql
-- To check the fragmentation of a rowstore index
SELECT a.object_id, object_name(a.object_id) AS TableName,
    a.index_id, name AS IndedxName, avg_fragmentation_in_percent
FROM sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats
    (DB_ID (N'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX')
        , OBJECT_ID(N'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX')
        , NULL
        , NULL
        , NULL) AS a
INNER JOIN sys.indexes AS b
    ON a.object_id = b.object_id
    AND a.index_id = b.index_id;
GO

-- To check the fragmentation of a columnstore index 
SELECT i.object_id,
    object_name(i.object_id) AS TableName,
    i.index_id,
    i.name AS IndexName,
    100*(ISNULL(SUM(CSRowGroups.deleted_rows),0))/NULLIF(SUM(CSRowGroups.total_rows),0) AS 'Fragmentation'
FROM sys.indexes AS i  
INNER JOIN sys.dm_db_column_store_row_group_physical_stats AS CSRowGroups
    ON i.object_id = CSRowGroups.object_id
    AND i.index_id = CSRowGroups.index_id
WHERE object_name(i.object_id) = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
GROUP BY i.object_id, i.index_id, i.name
ORDER BY object_name(i.object_id), i.name;

--To reorganize a fragmented index
ALTER INDEX IX_Employee_OrganizationalLevel_OrganizationalNode
    ON HumanResources.Employee
    REORGANIZE;

-- This command will force all CLOSED and OPEN rowgroups into the columnstore.
ALTER INDEX IndFactResellerSalesXL_CCI
    ON FactResellerSalesXL_CCI
    REORGANIZE WITH (COMPRESS_ALL_ROW_GROUPS = ON);

--To reorganize all indexes in a table
ALTER INDEX ALL ON HumanResources.Employee
   REORGANIZE;

--To rebuild a fragmented index
ALTER INDEX PK_Employee_BusinessEntityID ON HumanResources.Employee
REBUILD;

--To rebuild all indexes in a table
ALTER INDEX ALL ON Production.Product
REBUILD WITH (FILLFACTOR = 80, SORT_IN_TEMPDB = ON,
              STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = ON);

--INDEX
CREATE INDEX IX_Address_PostalCode  
ON Person.Address (PostalCode)  
INCLUDE (AddressLine1, AddressLine2, City, StateProvinceID);  

--NONCLUSTERED INDEX
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_PurchaseOrderDetail_RejectedQty  
ON Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail  
    (RejectedQty DESC, ProductID ASC, DueDate, OrderQty);

--CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
CREATE CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX [CCI_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX] ON [XXXXXXX].[XXXXXXX]
WITH (DROP_EXISTING = OFF, COMPRESSION_DELAY = 0, DATA_COMPRESSION = COLUMNSTORE) ON [PRIMARY]
GO
